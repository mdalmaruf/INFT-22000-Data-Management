# üìö Student Enrollment Database - MySQL Implementation

This project implements a **Student Enrollment System** using **MySQL**, designed to introduce relational database concepts in a simple, step-by-step approach.

---

## üìå **Database Creation and Design**
### **Why This Database?**
A **Student Enrollment System** helps manage students, courses, enrollments, and assignments efficiently. The database ensures:
- **Data Integrity** using primary and foreign keys.
- **Consistency** in enrollments and assignments.
- **Ease of Querying** for reporting and analysis.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Primary Key (PK):** Ensures each record is unique.
- **Foreign Key (FK):** Links tables together, enforcing relationships.
- **Constraints:** Maintain valid data entries (e.g., Grade between 0-100).
- **Normalization:** Avoids redundancy and maintains efficiency.

## üîó **Creating the Database and Tables**

### **Step 1: Create the Database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE StudentEnrollmentDB;
USE StudentEnrollmentDB;
```

### **Step 2: Create Tables**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Staff Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Staff (
    StaffNo INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Region VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```
**Explanation:**
- `StaffNo` is the **Primary Key**.
- `Region` ensures that staff members are assigned to a specific area.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Student Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Registered DATE NOT NULL,
    Region VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    StaffNo INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StaffNo) REFERENCES Staff(StaffNo) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```
**Explanation:**
- `StudentID` is the **Primary Key**.
- `StaffNo` is a **Foreign Key** linking students to a **Staff member (advisor)**.
- `ON DELETE SET NULL` allows students to exist even if their assigned staff leaves.


![Staff-Course Relationship](./Images/staff_course_erd.jpg)
#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Course Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseCode VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Credit INT CHECK (Credit IN (15, 30)), 
    Quota INT NOT NULL,
    StaffNo INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (StaffNo) REFERENCES Staff(StaffNo) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```
**Explanation:**
- `CourseCode` is the **Primary Key**.
- `Credit` is restricted to **15 or 30** using `CHECK`.
- `StaffNo` links a course to an instructor.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Enrollment Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseCode VARCHAR(10),
    DateEnrolled DATE NOT NULL,
    FinalGrade INT CHECK (FinalGrade BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseCode),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseCode) REFERENCES Course(CourseCode) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
**Explanation:**
- Composite **Primary Key (StudentID, CourseCode)** ensures a student can enroll in a course only once.
- `FinalGrade` must be between **0-100**.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` removes enrollments if a student or course is deleted.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Assignment Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Assignment (
    AssignmentNo INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseCode VARCHAR(10),
    Grade INT CHECK (Grade BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID, CourseCode) REFERENCES Enrollment(StudentID, CourseCode) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
**Explanation:**
- **Composite Primary Key (StudentID, CourseCode, AssignmentNo)** ensures uniqueness.
- `Grade` must be between **0-100**.
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` removes assignments if the related enrollment is deleted.

## üî¢ **Insert Sample Data**
### **Step 3: Add Sample Data**

#### **üë®‚Äçüè´ Staff Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO Staff (Name, Region) VALUES 
('Dr. Smith', 'North'),
('Prof. Johnson', 'South');
```

#### **üë®‚Äçüéì Student Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO Student (Name, Registered, Region, StaffNo) VALUES 
('Alice Brown', '2024-01-10', 'North', 1),
('Bob White', '2024-01-15', 'South', 2);
```

#### **üìö Course Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO Course (CourseCode, Title, Credit, Quota, StaffNo) VALUES 
('CS101', 'Intro to Programming', 15, 50, 1),
('CS102', 'Software Engineering', 30, 40, 2);
```

#### **üìù Enrollment Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO Enrollment (StudentID, CourseCode, DateEnrolled, FinalGrade) VALUES 
(1, 'CS101', '2024-02-01', 85),
(2, 'CS102', '2024-02-02', 78);
```

#### **üìù Assignment Data**
```sql
INSERT INTO Assignment (StudentID, CourseCode, Grade) VALUES 
(1, 'CS101', 90),
(2, 'CS102', 75);
```

## üîé **Query Examples**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Get All Students and Their Enrolled Courses**
```sql
SELECT s.StudentID, s.Name, e.CourseCode, c.Title, e.FinalGrade
FROM Student s
JOIN Enrollment e ON s.StudentID = e.StudentID
JOIN Course c ON e.CourseCode = c.CourseCode;
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Assignments of a Specific Student**
```sql
SELECT a.StudentID, s.Name, a.CourseCode, a.AssignmentNo, a.Grade
FROM Assignment a
JOIN Student s ON a.StudentID = s.StudentID
WHERE s.Name = 'Alice Brown';
```

---

## üîÆ **Conclusion**
- **Students will learn step by step**, from creating tables to inserting and querying data.
- **Primary & Foreign Keys** enforce integrity and relationships.
- **Constraints** maintain valid data.
- The **Entity Diagram and ERD diagrams** visually represent relationships, cardinality, and constraints.
